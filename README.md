### Project Overview: Streamlined Personality Switching with Pre-Prompts

In the evolving landscape of AI interaction, providing users with flexible and personalized experiences is key. Our GitHub project aims to simplify this process for users of ChatGPT 4o by offering a collection of pre-prompt files in both PDF and text formats. These pre-prompts are designed to enable users to quickly and easily switch between different AI personalities, enhancing their interaction with the model according to their specific needs.

#### Purpose and Utility

The primary goal of this project is to offer a structured yet user-friendly way for individuals to alter the personality and response style of ChatGPT. This can be particularly useful for varied applications such as creative writing, customer service, educational tools, and more. By simply uploading the desired pre-prompt file, users can tailor their interactions without needing extensive prompt engineering skills.

#### Components of the Project

1. **Pre-Prompt Files**:
   - **PDF Format**: These files provide a comprehensive and visually formatted set of instructions and personality guidelines. The PDF format is ideal for users who prefer a detailed, structured, and easily readable format.
   - **Text Format**: These files offer a plain text version of the pre-prompts, which are lightweight and can be quickly uploaded or integrated into various applications and platforms.

2. **Personality Variants**:
   - Each pre-prompt file defines a specific personality or set of characteristics that ChatGPT will emulate. This could range from a formal, professional tone to a casual, conversational style, or even specialized personas such as a technical advisor or a creative storyteller.

3. **User Instructions**:
   - Each pre-prompt includes clear instructions on how to upload and apply it within the ChatGPT interface. This ensures that even users with minimal technical expertise can benefit from the personalization features.

#### Implementation and Usage

Users can access the repository on GitHub, where they will find categorized folders containing the pre-prompt files. The structure of the repository will be as follows:

- **/pre-prompts**
